Gamma encoding makes the numbers larger/whiter.

Linear:							sRGB gamma encoded
  0.0 -- is black					0.0
  0.20	(18% gray card)					0.4845 (#7C7C7C)
  0.214							0.5 (#808080)
  0.5							0.7354 (#BCBCBC)
  1.0 -- is the white point				1.0


TEST 1:
  Surface format: B8G8R8A8_UNorm
  Surface color space: SRGBNonLinear
  I wrote middle gray.
  The output was DARKER than middle gray.

  Conclusion:  I need to encoded it into SRGB, since the format is UNorm, but the
    expected color space is SRGB.

TEST 2:
  Surface format: B8G8R8A8_sRGB
  Surface color space: SRGBNonLinear
  I wrote middle gray.
  The output was IDENTICAL to middle gray.

  Conclusion:  I dont need to encode it into SRGB, since the format is sRGB and that
    means vulkan does it for me.
